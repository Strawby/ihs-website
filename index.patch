             <h2>Get Under the Earth’s Edge</h2>
             <p>
               Step into the dimly-lit sanctuary of the caves at Indian Hot Springs and surrender 
               to a world below-the-surface. Carved deep into the mountain side, these geothermal 
               caverns wrap you in warm mineral-rich water and near-sauna air, offering quietude 
               and primal renewal just minutes from Denver. With the sound of steady drips and 
               soft echoing stones, you’ll forget the bustle of daily life. Here, phones stay 
               locked, conversation fades—restore your body in hot pools, recline on tile benches, 
               rise refreshed. Whether you go midday for serene escape or in the gentle hush of 
               evening for a private recharge, the caves promise a wholly different kind of detox.
