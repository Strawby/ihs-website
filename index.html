            <p>
              When you walk into our atrium and see the banana trees surrounding a
              turquoise mineral-water pool, you’ll forget you’re only 30 minutes away
              from Denver. A historic and cherished place, Indian Hot Springs is a
              destination for our naturally heated botanic swimming pool, caves, outdoor
              tubs, spa treatments, and accommodations. Weekends are a great time to bring
              the family, and weekdays are perfect for sneaking away from the city for
              much-needed relaxation.

            <p>
              Step into the dimly-lit sanctuary of the caves at Indian Hot Springs and surrender 
              to a world below-the-surface. Carved deep into the mountain side, these geothermal 
              caverns wrap you in warm mineral-rich water and sauna air, offering quietude 
              and primal renewal just minutes from Denver. Here, phones stay locked and conversation 
              fades. Restore your body in hot pools, recline on tile benches, and rise refreshed.

          <h2>Rooted in cedar, open to the mountains</h2>
          <p>
              Crafted from aromatic cedar and fed by continuously flowing mineral water, our 
              outdoor cedar tubs offer a deeper, more restorative soak with twice the volume 
              of a standard tub. Privacy fencing creates a quiet sanctuary, while the open 
              mountain sky above brings a sense of calm and fresh air. Designed for comfort, 
              warmth, and wellness, these tubs provide a peaceful retreat where you can stretch 
              out, unwind, and let the natural properties of cedar and mineral-rich water renew 
              you—just minutes from Denver.

          <h2>Where Quiet Comes Naturally</h2>
          <p>
              Built from smooth, pale birch and designed for quiet, meditative soaking, the Birch 
              Bath offers a lighter, brighter take on relaxation. Birch’s naturally clean, crisp 
              scent and gentle warmth create a calming atmosphere, while the continuously refreshed 
              mineral water envelopes you in soothing heat. With its soft wood grain, deep-set design, 
              and peaceful outdoor setting, the Birch Bath provides a serene retreat where you can ease 
              tired muscles, settle your mind, and enjoy a moment of simple, restorative stillness 
              beneath the mountain air.

          <h2>A Historic Geological Landmark</h2>
          <p>
            Long before settlers reached Soda Creek, the Ute and Arapaho nations considered the hot springs a sacred healing ground. In 1863,
            the land was purchased and the first baths were built by George A. Jackson — with geological activity keeping the water hot ever
            since. As a preserved historic site more than 150-years-old, we appreciate your respect for the quirks of our building as we
            renovate and preserve for the future. Stay tuned for more on our seven-year plan.
