           <p class="section-summary">You may think that it's impossible to have a tropical getaway in the middle of the mountains. Thanks to our staff botanist, and a magical sparkling dome, the main swimming pool gives off tropical vacation vibes all year long.</p>
         <p class="section-summary">The hot mineral waters have been used to heal for centuries and you'll feel the benefits with whatever soaking style you choose&mdash;whether it's a slow paddle, a steady walk, or claiming a spot on one of the many built-in benches. While you're letting the tropical turquoise waters work their wonders, make sure to gaze around the edge and marvel at the banana trees, ferns, and flowers&mdash;many of which you won't find anywhere else in Colorado.</p>
            <h2>Plan Your Soak</h2>
