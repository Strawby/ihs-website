            <p>
              Surrounded by towering banana trees and warm, turquoise mineral water, our botanic pool offers a calming escape
              from everyday rhythm. Naturally heated and softly lit by the atrium’s glass canopy, it’s a place to float, breathe,
              and unwind—just 30 minutes from Denver. Whether you’re here with family on the weekend or sneaking in a peaceful
              weekday soak, the pool invites you to slow down and let the warmth restore you.

            <p>
              Venture into the dim, mineral-rich caverns carved deep into the mountainside. Heated by the earth and filled with
              naturally occurring steam and soaking pools, the caves offer primal quietude just moments from the city. Phones stay
              away, voices soften, and the world narrows to stone, warmth, and breath. Settle into the heat, let your muscles
              loosen, and rise renewed.

            <h2>Where Cedar Meets the Mountain Air</h2>            <p>
              Crafted from aromatic cedar and continuously supplied with flowing mineral water, our outdoor cedar tubs provide a deeply
              grounding soak set against a beautiful mountainside view. Privacy fencing creates a secluded haven, while the open
              mountain sky above brings crisp air and calm. Stretch out, breathe deep, and let the cedar and minerals work their quiet
              magic.

              stillness.

            <p>
              Our Mud Room brings the natural benefits of mineral-rich clay directly to the skin. Gently warmed and deeply detoxifying,
              the mud draws out impurities while soothing muscles and improving circulation. As you rest in the quiet heat, tension
              dissolves and your body feels light, balanced, and refreshed. It’s a timeless ritual—simple, grounding, and profoundly
              renewing.

            <h2>A Historic Geological Landmark</h2>
            <p>
                Long before settlers reached Soda Creek, the Ute and Arapaho nations considered the hot springs a sacred healing ground. 
                In 1863, the land was purchased and the first baths were built by George A. Jackson — with geological activity keeping 
                the water hot ever since. As a preserved historic site more than 150-years-old, we appreciate your respect for the quirks 
                of our building as we renovate and preserve for the future. Stay tuned for more on our seven-year plan.
