              <p class="section-summary">Step back in time without sacrificing comfort. Built in 1905, these rooms are a quiet tribute to the character and craftsmanship of another era. Inside, you’ll find classic steam radiators, original water closets (½ bath), and the warm, familiar scent of aged wood, a gentle reminder of the stories held within these walls. Each room has been thoughtfully updated with modern essentials, all while honoring its unique history. Nestled along the resort’s historic hallways, you might even find yourself sleeping where iconic guests like Jesse James or the Roosevelts once stayed. Just steps away are the caves, mineral pool, private baths, outdoor tubs, and dining hall, timeless experiences that have welcomed travelers for over a century.</p>
