                  When you walk into our atrium and see the banana trees surrounding a 
                  turquoise mineral-water pool, you’ll forget you’re only 30 minutes away 
                  from Denver. A historic and cherished place, Indian Hot Springs is a 
                  destination for our naturally heated botanic swimming pool, caves, outdoor 
                  tubs, spa treatments, and accommodations. Weekends are a great time to bring 
                  the family, and weekdays are perfect for sneaking away from the city for 
                  much-needed relaxation.

            <h2>Get Under the Earth’s Edge</h2>
            <p>
              Step into the dimly-lit sanctuary of the caves at Indian Hot Springs and surrender 
              to a world below-the-surface. Carved deep into the mountain side, these geothermal 
              caverns wrap you in warm mineral-rich water and near-sauna air, offering quietude 
              and primal renewal just minutes from Denver. With the sound of steady drips and 
              soft echoing stones, you’ll forget the bustle of daily life. Here, phones stay 
              locked, conversation fades—restore your body in hot pools, recline on tile benches, 
              rise refreshed. Whether you go midday for serene escape or in the gentle hush of 
              evening for a private recharge, the caves promise a wholly different kind of detox.

              Book your stay at Indian Hot Springs, and give yourself time to soak it all in. We’re 
              a great place to remind you that you don’t need a plane, thousands of dollars, or weeks 
              of vacation to enjoy a break and come away with a fresh perspective. Enjoy the serenity 
              of one of our conveniently located rooms, or book a cabin as a cozy getaway for the 
              entire family. It’s the perfect way to make the most of your stay.
