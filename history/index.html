              Ute and Arapaho tribes began migrating through modern day Colorado using the Soda Creek
              hot springs as sacred land for worship and to heal their sick and wounded.

              George A. Jackson made the first discovery of gold in the Rockies in Chicago Creek (a
              short distance from Indian Hot Springs). In his journals he writes of visiting the hot
              springs a few days before striking gold.

              Dr. E.M. Cummings bought land from two frustrated miners who called their property a
              “hot water mine” because they only found water when looking for gold. He builds a log
              and wood frame house and starts charging the public for “health baths.”

              Cummings sells the property to Harrison Montague who tears down the cabin and builds a
              stone bath house that he calls the “Ocean Bath House.”

              United States Geological Survey Report publishes a report explaining that the ores
              (including gold) deposited in this area are due to waters and gasses emanating from
              igneous magma deep within the mountain core.

          <h2>Healing waters of the Great Spirit</h2>
          <p>
            Long before white settlers took their first steps along Soda Creek, the Ute and Arapaho
            nations considered the hot springs as sacred ground where they could worship and bring
            their sick and wounded for healing. By the time white settlers arrived looking for gold
            in the mid 1800s, Soda Creek (which runs in front of the Indian Hot Springs Resort) was
            considered the dividing line between the Ute and Arapaho nations and had long been treated
            as neutral ground. By the late 1800s, Harrison Montague had constructed a stone bath house
            and began calling the region the “Saratoga of the Rocky Mountains.” Fun fact: much of the
            original structure and even a wooden gazebo from the late 1800s is still in use today.
            The resort has always been a popular place for visitors traveling throughout the region
            and over the years played host to plenty of historical figures. Historical records
            indicate that the resort has been visited by Frank and Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Sara
            Berhardt, Walt Whitman, Baby Doe Tabor, the Vanderbilts, and the Roosevelts. If you’re
            looking for us to name drop famous people a little more modern, well, Clint Eastwood,
            John Denver, John McEuen, Leon Russell, Bo Diddley, and plenty of others have all stopped
            by to soak with us, too.

          <h2>A new chapter</h2>
          <p>
            Since the 1970s the Lee family has been invested in the Colorado hospitality industry and
            has dedicated themselves to creating memorable experiences for visitors with a variety of
            hotels and resorts. In 2014, the Lees took over Indian Hot Springs and promised the
            previous owners that they wouldn’t let the resort turn into a fading memory. Having
            previously owned Hot Sulphur Springs, the Lee Family knew that they wanted to preserve
            the history of Indian Hot Springs without turning it into a cookie cutter attraction.

          <h2>Moving forward with intention</h2>
          <p>
            The Lees have always aimed to surprise and delight their visitors while maintaining
            loyalty and respect to their staff and the local community. It might seem cheesy but
            it’s true—the heart of their vision for Indian Hot Springs is to make people feel good.
            Part of that means making operational updates that will allow the historic pools to age
            gracefully. Part of that means adding new offerings and lodging that enrich your stay.
            Part of that means showcasing history in new ways. But the biggest part of that vision
            means enhancing your favorite relaxing getaway without breaking your budget.
